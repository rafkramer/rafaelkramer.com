        <h2>story ðŸ“–</h2>
        <p>started at a very young age, always knew i'd be successful, i'm nowhere near where I want to be yet though - this is a very condensed version of my story thus-far:</p>

        <p>first success was developing my own crappy meme mobile games and building a personal brand to promote them</p>

        <p>took me about a year to master and made me 6 figures at the age of 14, which flipped a switch, showed me the world is moldable and anything is possible</p>

        <p>moved on from tiktok / games after about another year, then created a startup, built that for another two years, fucked up a lot, learnt a lot, sold it</p>

        <p>had a couple months of just doing random projects I was curious about, then founded kramer ventures (venture studio, so rn i'm involved in building several business simultaneously)</p>

        <p>throughout all this i've been finishing school and am now finally in my last semester, been able to maintain a healthy social life, mental / physical health, priorities beside biz - although this was hard to do at first</p>

        <p>i'm 18 now and the biggest learnings in the first conscious years of my life haven't necessarily been about business, more about how to navigate being a human lol - I write a lot about this topic personally, may share here at some point</p>
